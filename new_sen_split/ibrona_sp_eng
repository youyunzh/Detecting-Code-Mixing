00:44:09 00:44:09 1049 yeah 
00:44:09 00:44:15 1050 because in some of the sort of Austrian Institute posh events, they are 
00:44:15 00:44:15 1051 no that is not a posh 
00:44:15 00:44:16 1052 awfully boring 
00:44:16 00:44:17 1053 no no no definitely not 
00:44:17 00:44:19 1054 I just didn't enjoy myself there 
00:44:19 00:44:19 1055 no no no 
00:44:19 00:44:20 1056 all the people dressed up 
00:44:20 00:44:22 1057 no no this is definitely not like that 
00:44:22 00:44:24 1058 I just don't really feel at home there 
00:44:24 00:44:26 1059 but some of them dress up don't they 
00:44:26 00:44:28 1060 yeah but I mean not posh 
00:44:28 00:44:29 1061 there is one or two, I think, they like 
00:44:29 00:44:30 1062 na ja one 
00:44:30 00:44:32 1063 so what is this for you know your studies or 
00:44:32 00:44:34 1064 it's for my dissertation yeah 
00:44:34 00:44:36 1065 what does that mean dissertation 
00:44:36 00:44:39 1066 well doctorate P_H_D paper 
00:44:39 00:44:40 1067 and what 
00:44:40 00:44:41 1068 in linguistics 
00:44:41 00:44:42 1069 ah just eh 
00:44:42 00:44:46 1070 well I mean, my field is bilingualism 
00:44:46 00:44:46 1071 yeah 
00:44:46 00:44:50 1072 and I'm studying second language acquisition 
00:44:50 00:44:53 1073 and whether the second language blocks out the first language 
00:44:53 00:44:55 1074 or whether they mix 
00:44:55 00:45:00 1075 or whether one language becomes for example a second language becomes dominant 
00:45:00 00:45:03 1076 or whether the first language remains dominant 
00:45:03 00:45:06 1077 what are you finding in your studies at the moment 
00:45:06 00:45:09 1078 completely mixed, As I told your mum earlier on 
00:45:09 00:45:11 1079 it would be interesting to know, what your findings are 
00:45:11 00:45:13 1080 yeah completely mixed 
00:45:13 00:45:19 1081 I mean up to now ah I can't really generalize generalize any results not at all 
00:45:19 00:45:21 1082 because some people only speak German 
00:45:21 00:45:22 1083 some only speak English 
00:45:22 00:45:28 1084 and one lady, for example yeah I told you earlier on she refuses to speak English 
00:45:28 00:45:30 1085 and she finds it hard to 
00:45:30 00:45:31 1086 like the xxx 
00:45:31 00:45:37 1087 xxx with mixed German English speakers she just refuses to speak English, although she can 
00:45:37 00:45:41 1088 and another woman &=um she was married to an Austrian that's interesting 
00:45:41 00:45:45 1089 and he was a journalist and got a job here 
00:45:45 00:45:48 1090 and he was offered a job in nineteen thirty eight already 
00:45:48 00:45:50 1091 ja 
00:45:50 00:45:53 1092 and &-um they left Austria before Hitler came 
00:45:53 00:45:53 1093 ja 
00:45:53 00:46:01 1094 and since her husband was a journalist, he had to learn English really quickly to write for this newspaper 
00:46:01 00:46:01 1095 ja 
00:46:01 00:46:03 1096 and she just went along with him 
00:46:03 00:46:06 1097 and I tried to speak German 
00:46:06 00:46:08 1098 she said, 0conj she doesn't mind speaking German 
00:46:08 00:46:11 1099 so I I spoke German told her stories 
00:46:11 00:46:11 1100 ja ja 
00:46:11 00:46:13 1101 and then I asked her questions 
00:46:13 00:46:14 1102 and she responded in English 
00:46:14 00:46:19 1103 and she didn't even notice, that she started speaking English immediately 
00:46:19 00:46:22 1104 or sometimes the first two or three words came out in German 
00:46:22 00:46:24 1105 and then she went back to English again 
00:46:24 00:46:33 1106 but I couldn't tell you, how most people speak because up to now, I haven't found any generalizable tendencies 
00:46:33 00:46:35 1107 doesn't it depend on who they 
00:46:35 00:46:39 1108 where they live where they live Vivien 
00:46:39 00:46:41 1109 if you live in the country, you have to speak English all the time 
00:46:41 00:46:42 1110 but if you live 
00:46:44 00:46:47 1112 yes xxx I will introduce you to my friend 
00:46:47 00:46:49 1113 she she married a German 
00:46:49 00:46:53 1114 and he was so jealous 
00:46:53 00:46:54 1115 he was much older than her 
00:46:54 00:46:55 1116 he was very jealous 
00:46:55 00:46:55 1117 &-um 
00:46:55 00:46:57 1118 and he was in the army 
00:46:57 00:46:59 1119 and he didn't want to live in London
