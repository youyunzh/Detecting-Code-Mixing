00:00:02 00:00:03 1 ja ja ja 
00:00:03 00:00:05 2 but Trude lived with English people 
00:00:05 00:00:07 3 but her husband was German 
00:00:07 00:00:12 4 but she said, 0conj they only speak at home German eh English 
00:00:12 00:00:13 5 they never talk eh 
00:00:13 00:00:18 6 now in contrast from what you are saying, I am the only English child of of a foreign family 
00:00:18 00:00:22 7 now I don't know if she said, there is a couple 
00:00:22 00:00:22 8 you remember Roger 
00:00:22 00:00:23 9 now he speaks with a German accent 
00:00:23 00:00:24 10 ja ja 
00:00:24 00:00:28 11 and no one believed, 0conj I had a foreign parents 
00:00:28 00:00:28 12 yeah 
00:00:28 00:00:29 13 because I spoke 
00:00:29 00:00:30 14 of course 
00:00:30 00:00:33 15 English very without an accent 
00:00:33 00:00:38 16 I know one or two people who spoke, as I said 
00:00:38 00:00:39 17 but Roger is born in Vienna, Vivien 
00:00:39 00:00:41 18 he was only one year, when he left 
00:00:41 00:00:42 19 but that was 
00:00:42 00:00:44 20 yeah I don't think 
00:00:44 00:00:45 21 but he no he puts it on 
00:00:45 00:00:52 22 he is you know his parents are both Viennese and he speaks with such an accent 
00:00:52 00:00:53 23 and he is about fifty 
00:00:53 00:00:56 24 he's fifty one fifty two fifty three 
00:00:56 00:00:58 25 and he left Austria at the age of one 
00:00:58 00:00:59 26 one yeah 
00:00:59 00:01:00 27 yes, I mean, how can it make any difference 
00:01:00 00:01:01 28 that's what I'm saying 
00:01:01 00:01:02 29 no he puts 
00:01:02 00:01:02 30 no he doesn't put 
00:01:02 00:01:05 31 xxx he wants to be different ja ja 
00:01:05 00:01:08 32 very strong 
00:01:08 00:01:10 33 he's got a stronger accent than I have 
00:01:10 00:01:10 34 but you find 
00:01:10 00:01:12 35 sorry 
00:01:12 00:01:14 36 you find most people they retain their accent 
00:01:14 00:01:15 37 most people do 
00:01:15 00:01:32 38 but what I find quite interesting 0is, 0conj there are linguistic theories that claim that after the age of six seven till up to the age of ten you can acquire the sound systems of of a new language quite easily 
00:01:32 00:01:33 39 ja 
00:01:33 00:01:36 40 and after the age of ten, you wouldn't learn it any longer 
00:01:36 00:01:42 41 you just can't can't pick up foreign sounds 
00:01:42 00:01:44 42 and can't get them out any longer 
00:01:44 00:01:45 43 really 
00:01:45 00:01:49 44 but that's not trueâ†‘ because I got to know people one Austrian www 
00:01:49 00:01:54 45 he left Austria at the age of sixteen 
00:01:54 00:01:57 46 so he was quite old, when he came here 
00:01:57 00:02:00 47 and he doesn't have any accent whatsoever 
00:02:00 00:02:02 48 and a Czech young man 
00:02:02 00:02:05 49 he's only a couple of years younger than me 
00:02:05 00:02:10 50 and he's only been here for a year 
00:02:10 00:02:11 51 and his English is perfect 
00:02:11 00:02:17 52 and I felt so ashamed, when I was told, that he's only been here for a year 
00:02:17 00:02:22 53 and but he on the other hand he knows exactly, 0that he wants to settle down here 
00:02:22 00:02:26 54 he cut his life back home off completely 
00:02:26 00:02:27 55 ja ja ja 
00:02:27 00:02:29 56 and I'm still moving to and fro and 
00:02:29 00:02:30 57 ja ja ja 
00:02:30 00:02:33 58 spend one year in Austria one year in England 
00:02:33 00:02:33 59 ja ja ja ja 
00:02:33 00:02:34 60 somehow I'm not xxx 
00:02:34 00:02:36 61 you are not settled 
00:02:36 00:02:38 62 and I don't really want to be completely British 
00:02:38 00:02:40 63 ja sure not ja 
00:02:40 00:02:47 64 but those people, as you said about your friend those people cut their past 
00:02:47 00:02:47 65 away 
00:02:47 00:02:49 66 off completely 
00:02:49 00:02:50 67 like Susan 
00:02:50 00:02:50 68 I told you about Susan 
00:02:50 00:02:52 69 in Hull 
00:02:52 00:02:53 70 ja ja 
00:02:53 00:02:54 71 yeah but having said that, it's not German 
00:02:54 00:03:00 72 I'm just saying it would be interesting because I have friends let's say in different xxx nationalities 
00:03:00 00:03:04 73 I have you know like who came here, when they were nineteen and twenty 
00:03:04 00:03:07 74 and they speak worse English than my mother 
00:03:07 00:03:09 75 you know with such a strong accent 
00:03:09 00:03:11 76 and they are younger than you 
00:03:11 00:03:14 77 you'd think, that after all this they had elocution they were in business here 
00:03:14 00:03:16 78 but they 
00:03:16 00:03:17 79 but they speak such terrible English 
00:03:17 00:03:21 80 and yet, I'm just saying, another advantage going in reverse 
00:03:21 00:03:23 81 I've got some friends, who went to Canada 
00:03:23 00:03:27 82 now she has retained her English accent beautifully 
00:03:27 00:03:28 83 but he speaks like an American 
00:03:28 00:03:29 84 &-um yeah 
00:03:29 00:03:35 85 so is it to do let's say weak charactered weak 
00:03:35 00:03:41 86 or the way you because she has been they've been there now twenty six twenty seven years 
00:03:41 00:03:45 87 and you speak to her she has retained her English accent her beautiful English voice 
00:03:45 00:03:47 88 and you speak to him he's like an American isn't he 
00:03:47 00:03:56 89 I think, 0conj it always depends in how far you identify with the country, where you are living 
00:03:56 00:04:00 90 obviously none of you lot did identify did you 
00:04:00 00:04:01 91 no 
00:04:01 00:04:02 92 you still talk of home as Austria 
00:04:02 00:04:03 93 ja 
00:04:03 00:04:04 94 it's true 
00:04:04 00:04:05 95 I mean it's got to be 
00:04:05 00:04:08 96 when when we say, 0conj we go home, we don't mean 
00:04:08 00:04:10 97 which is is really quite sad 
00:04:10 00:04:12 98 xxx 
00:04:12 00:04:13 99 yes but we all do 
00:04:13 00:04:14 100 I know but you 
00:04:14 00:04:16 101 yeah 
00:04:16 00:04:18 102 she can't understand but xxx 
00:04:18 00:04:20 103 no I don't understand it 
00:04:20 00:04:21 104 but we don't say it just slips out 
00:04:21 00:04:23 105 it seems quite sad, that you've been in this country for so long 
00:04:23 00:04:25 106 it's more you've been here more than 
00:04:25 00:04:26 107 oh sure I've been more 
00:04:26 00:04:28 108 so obviously as you are saying, it is the first formative years 
00:04:28 00:04:29 109 ja 
00:04:29 00:04:32 110 ten fifteen whatever is your home 
00:04:32 00:04:33 111 then after, you just 
00:04:33 00:04:35 112 drift away 
00:04:35 00:04:38 113 yeah we've been talking about it earlier 
00:04:38 00:04:39 114 schooling is very important as well 
00:04:39 00:04:41 115 ja 
00:04:41 00:04:46 116 when you did most of your schooling in in one country, you you just eh 
00:04:46 00:04:52 117 I mean you do extend your vocabulary during your school years quite a lot 
00:04:52 00:04:57 118 and you just don't acquire that many words after school any longer 
00:04:57 00:05:00 119 I mean you still pick up new words but not that many 
00:05:00 00:05:05 120 and you don't most people don't read as much, when they leave school 
00:05:05 00:05:07 121 so schooling is quite important as well 
00:05:07 00:05:08 122 exactly 
00:05:08 00:05:15 123 and especially I find out that those people, who few people very very few people went to boarding schools 
00:05:15 00:05:16 124 ja ja ja 
00:05:16 00:05:20 125 and their English is perfect 
00:05:20 00:05:20 126 ja na sure 
00:05:20 00:05:23 127 Docter Zerner for example 
00:05:23 00:05:24 128 ja ja ja 
00:05:24 00:05:32 129 he told me, that he was sent to a boarding school and after about three weeks he fell ill 
00:05:32 00:05:33 130 0he was taken taken to the hospital 
00:05:33 00:05:37 131 and his teacher in the class spoke German 
00:05:37 00:05:41 132 so in the classroom he would get away with speaking German, when he couldn't express himself in English 
00:05:41 00:05:45 133 but in the hospital there was nobody, who spoke German 
00:05:45 00:05:45 134 ja 
00:05:45 00:05:52 135 and he told me, that he learnt English within two or three weeks in the time, when he was at the hospital 
00:05:52 00:05:54 136 because he just got bored 
00:05:54 00:05:55 137 ja ja ja 
00:05:55 00:06:01 138 and he wanted to talk to somebody so he just listened in to what people were saying 
00:06:01 00:06:01 139 that's right 
00:06:01 00:06:04 140 and he said, 0conj within a couple of weeks he could make himself understood 
00:06:04 00:06:05 141 ja ja 
00:06:05 00:06:08 142 and he doesn't have any accent either 
00:06:08 00:06:08 143 no 
00:06:08 00:06:11 144 he speaks English as very good 
00:06:11 00:06:11 145 ja ja ja 
00:06:11 00:06:18 146 and you find mostly I find people from Scandinavian countries 
00:06:18 00:06:22 147 if you hear them speak English, hardly a trace of an accent 
00:06:22 00:06:23 148 true 
00:06:23 00:06:25 149 I don't know what it is 
00:06:25 00:06:26 150 I mean I don't know have you noticed 
00:06:26 00:06:27 151 ja but 
00:06:27 00:06:29 152 xxx Slovak 
00:06:31 00:06:33 154 xxx Scandinavians 
00:06:33 00:06:34 155 ja ja ja 
00:06:34 00:06:37 156 xxx you've heard Scandianavian people 
00:06:37 00:06:40 157 they speak with hardly an accent 
00:06:40 00:06:41 158 really 
00:06:41 00:06:42 159 sure 
00:06:42 00:06:46 160 why I mean why is it they xxx you know 
00:06:46 00:06:47 161 what really stuns me 
00:06:47 00:06:50 162 I mean they speak English with hardly any accent at all 
00:06:50 00:06:52 163 and they also speak German 
00:06:52 00:06:53 164 ja ja ja 
00:06:53 00:06:54 165 with hardly any accent 
00:06:54 00:07:02 166 a Danish friend of mine her English is brilliant and I mean she is a bit hesitant to speak German 
00:07:02 00:07:04 167 but her German is very very good 
00:07:04 00:07:07 168 and you can't even tell she's not German 
00:07:07 00:07:07 169 ja ja 
00:07:07 00:07:08 170 I mean she's obviously learned German at school 
00:07:08 00:07:10 171 at school ja ja 
00:07:10 00:07:15 172 and she must have had a very good teacher, because you couldn't pick it up from her accent 
00:07:15 00:07:16 173 ja ja 
00:07:16 00:07:17 174 that she was not German 
00:07:17 00:07:20 175 I don't know maybe maybe 
00:07:20 00:07:28 176 the teachers teach in such a way that you whatever it is if you speak English or if you learn French 
00:07:28 00:07:34 177 I'm just saying, or something you learn you still English people tend to speak it with an English accent 
00:07:34 00:07:36 178 whereas I think in xxx 
00:07:36 00:07:43 179 you know when I learnt French and English in school, we didn't learn like they do it now 
00:07:43 00:07:50 180 we learnt I could translate and I could read and translate but I couldn't speak like the modern thing 
00:07:50 00:07:53 181 actually you are speaking much better English now isn't it funny 
00:07:53 00:07:55 182 it shows because you are speaking English 
00:07:55 00:07:58 183 it depends 
00:07:58 00:07:59 184 mama we notice 
00:07:59 00:08:02 185 my son and I we have a laugh 
00:08:02 00:08:02 186 when you speak with your friends 
00:08:02 00:08:03 187 jaâ†‘ 
00:08:03 00:08:05 188 you don't realize 
00:08:05 00:08:06 189 of couse you don't realize 
00:08:06 00:08:09 190 but now, because you are speaking English altogether, you are speaking a better English 
00:08:09 00:08:10 191 because your English is very good 
00:08:10 00:08:11 192 mhm

00:10:37 00:10:37 273 really 
00:10:37 00:10:43 274 if you want, we can go earlierâ†‘ because at four thirty starts the quiz so you can't 
00:10:43 00:10:45 275 whenever you feel like it 
00:10:45 00:10:47 276 people are having tea there 
00:10:47 00:10:49 277 so you can sit at the tables and talk to them, while while they are having tea 
00:10:49 00:10:49 278 yeah yeah 
00:10:49 00:10:52 279 leave it and I'll do it for you 
00:10:52 00:10:53 280 no there is nothing to do 
00:10:53 00:10:54 281 can I give you a hand 
00:10:54 00:10:56 282 no no certainly not 
00:10:56 00:11:05 283 that will make my mother's day because she she is fed up with everyone having a go at her about her English 
00:11:05 00:11:08 284 xxx I don't take any notice 
00:11:08 00:11:09 285 it's so funny 
00:11:09 00:11:12 286 I got to know a family only two days ago 
00:11:12 00:11:17 287 the mother is Austrian father is British and they have twins 
00:11:17 00:11:21 288 they are I think two and a half three years old now 
00:11:21 00:11:24 289 and they are speaking quite a lot already 
00:11:24 00:11:29 290 and mixed German and English mix it up completely 
00:11:29 00:11:33 291 but because they are twins they have also got an 
00:11:33 00:11:35 292 a a language in between them 
00:11:35 00:11:36 293 ja ja 
00:11:36 00:11:40 294 so if if they don't want to be understood they manage perfectly well 
00:11:40 00:11:44 295 that nobody understands them not the father not the mother nobody 
00:11:44 00:11:48 296 xxx this mixed German and English xxx language 
00:11:48 00:11:50 297 so much fun 
00:11:50 00:11:54 298 the parents are badly pissed off and the grandparents even worse 
00:11:54 00:11:56 299 but it is weird, what they can do with their language 
00:11:56 00:11:58 300 it's really interesting 
00:11:58 00:12:01 301 in reverse you see 
00:12:01 00:12:05 302 because they only spoke German, I had to understand 
00:12:05 00:12:06 303 otherwise I never knew, what was going on 
00:12:06 00:12:07 304 of course 
00:12:07 00:12:08 305 xxx I never learnt German 
00:12:08 00:12:10 306 but did you pretend you didn't understand 
00:12:10 00:12:11 307 yes she did 
00:12:11 00:12:15 308 I only whatever I know, is from listening 
00:12:15 00:12:15 309 yeah 
00:12:15 00:12:18 310 I never studied it because I didn't study German 
00:12:18 00:12:19 311 yeah 
00:12:19 00:12:26 312 and in reverse though whenever I wanted to talk about something when I was married and had a child 
00:12:26 00:12:28 313 I had friends, who spoke German 
00:12:28 00:12:30 314 we spoke German, so our children didn't understand 
00:12:30 00:12:31 315 yeah 
00:12:31 00:12:36 316 but I mean that's all of them as I'm saying 
00:12:36 00:12:41 317 it's very peculiar because none of my friends know, that I have continental 0n 
00:12:41 00:12:41 318 well unless I told them 
00:12:41 00:12:44 319 you know when I when I phoned my daughter up in business 
00:12:44 00:12:45 320 you know I used to 
00:12:45 00:12:48 321 oh dear 
00:12:48 00:12:51 322 I find this interesting 
00:12:51 00:12:53 323 but then, you tend to mix with people 
00:12:53 00:12:55 324 I think, that's, what it is 
00:12:55 00:12:56 325 you tend to mix with people, 0conj you are familiar with 
00:12:56 00:13:03 326 Austrian people you know German people 
00:13:03 00:13:05 327 yeah yes your mum told me 
00:13:05 00:13:08 328 hello 
00:13:08 00:13:10 329 now you know my whole family 
00:13:10 00:13:10 330 this is my grandson 
00:13:10 00:13:12 331 this is Eva 
00:13:12 00:13:13 332 hello 
00:13:13 00:13:13 333 you are earlyâ†‘ 
00:13:13 00:13:14 334 how do you do 
00:13:14 00:13:15 335 fine 
00:13:15 00:13:16 336 pleased to meet you 
00:13:16 00:13:16 337 hi 
00:13:16 00:13:17 338 you're earlyâ†‘ 
00:13:17 00:13:19 339 yeah I finished early 
00:13:19 00:13:19 340 why is that 
00:13:19 00:13:23 341 &-um just xxx 
00:13:23 00:13:24 342 did you play football 
00:13:24 00:13:25 343 yeah I did 
00:13:25 00:13:26 344 I started at at a quarter to two 
00:13:26 00:13:26 345 it went on for an hour 
00:13:26 00:13:31 346 so I hope, 0conj you don't mind, if we leave you 
00:13:31 00:13:33 347 no not at all 
00:13:33 00:13:35 348 don't let me interrupt you if you wanna 
00:13:35 00:13:38 349 did you want a drink Eva 
00:13:38 00:13:38 350 xxx 
00:13:38 00:13:43 351 xxx sit xxx and talk to Eva before we are going yes 
00:13:43 00:13:47 352 Eva you are not gonna like this 
00:13:47 00:13:49 353 Eva says how wonderful grandma is and her language is 
00:13:49 00:13:50 354 yeahâ†‘ 
00:13:50 00:13:54 355 I said, 0conj we'd been telling her off you see because grandma always mixes them 
00:13:54 00:13:56 356 but it's just what Eva is looking for 
00:13:56 00:13:58 357 I mean I shouldn't have told your grandma 
00:13:58 00:14:00 358 but she would do it anyway I suppose 
00:14:00 00:14:02 359 especially when she meets up with her friends 
00:14:02 00:14:05 360 she would mix start mixing anyway 
00:14:05 00:14:08 361 and she was mixing quite a lot, when the two of us were speaking 
00:14:08 00:14:09 362 really 
00:14:09 00:14:10 363 yeah 
00:14:10 00:14:11 364 I bet she didn't realize it 
00:14:11 00:14:17 365 I think she did every now and then, because I didn't tell her at the very beginning only after maybe half an hour 
00:14:17 00:14:21 366 and I realized, that she for example started eh 
00:14:21 00:14:24 367 we were speaking German most of the time 
00:14:24 00:14:28 368 then she started sentences with but and because 
00:14:28 00:14:30 369 and then she carried on in German 
00:14:30 00:14:33 370 I don't know, whether she realized that 
00:14:33 00:14:37 371 but sometimes it seemed to me, as if she hesitated and 
00:14:37 00:14:41 372 because she was thinking what language to speak in 
00:14:41 00:14:41 373 yeah she wasn't sure 
00:14:41 00:14:49 374 and I'm sure, 0conj she would have mixed a lot more English in, if if she had known, that I was not keen on having two separate languages 
00:14:49 00:14:51 375 really 
00:14:51 00:14:51 376 &-um 
00:14:51 00:14:53 377 sounded very much like it 
00:14:53 00:14:55 378 it's gonna be very interesting at the club 
00:14:55 00:14:57 379 I am so much looking forward to it 
00:14:57 00:15:00 380 but what does someone do then with five 
00:15:00 00:15:02 381 I have an aunty, who speaks five languages 
00:15:02 00:15:07 382 I mean how do you manage that like Alice with five languages 
00:15:07 00:15:07 383 how does she 
00:15:07 00:15:09 384 I mean she's got to be so terribly brilliant 
00:15:09 00:15:10 385 I don't know 
00:15:10 00:15:11 386 to remember not to speak in a xxx 
00:15:11 00:15:12 387 she has got a gift for it 
00:15:12 00:15:13 388 no it's not a gift it's the brain 
00:15:13 00:15:14 389 the brain 
00:15:14 00:15:15 390 no it's the brain 
00:15:15 00:15:17 391 it is the brain you xxx to think 
00:15:17 00:15:23 392 no but you can some people have more more gifts than the others 
00:15:23 00:15:30 393 it shows you if you try darlingâ†‘ you can do it 
00:15:30 00:15:33 394 that's what we always say 
00:15:33 00:15:34 395 all the time they say it 
00:15:34 00:15:37 396 try, you can do it, if you want to concentrate 
00:15:37 00:15:39 397 they want to say xxx 
00:15:39 00:15:41 398 xxx 
00:15:41 00:15:44 399 what is it tell 
00:15:44 00:15:47 400 did you tell Eva about the story, when you went away with daddy with Nicolas about the glacier 
00:15:47 00:15:49 401 no I didn't 
00:15:49 00:15:49 402 you tell her 
00:15:49 00:15:56 403 we went my husband Nicolas was a little boy we went to the Grossglockner 
00:15:56 00:15:57 404 &-um 
00:15:57 00:16:00 405 and then we went this, you know, glacier 
00:16:00 00:16:01 406 there we go again 
00:16:01 00:16:04 407 I made it 
00:16:04 00:16:08 408 that was one of my things, when I had you know 
00:16:08 00:16:09 409 I I thought it is very important, to speak very good English 
00:16:09 00:16:12 410 so I always you know lots of other things 
00:16:12 00:16:15 411 but it opens lots of doors, if you speak a very good English you know 
00:16:15 00:16:16 412 yeah sure 
00:16:16 00:16:21 413 so I always made a point of reading and talking very nicely to my son so that he would speak a very good English 
00:16:21 00:16:23 414 of course he goes on holiday with my mum and dad 
00:16:23 00:16:25 415 and comes back 
00:16:25 00:16:28 416 and comes back 
00:16:28 00:16:30 417 xxx the impressionable age xxx 
00:16:30 00:16:35 418 I thought 
00:16:35 00:16:44 419 you are spoiling the whole education 
00:16:44 00:16:48 420 what did you say about sausages

00:17:22 00:17:25 436 and they all were amazed, because Nicolas had such beautiful manners you see 
00:17:25 00:17:26 437 yes of course yeah 
00:17:26 00:17:27 438 that's what I was thinking 
00:17:27 00:17:28 439 I mean everyone has got different priorities you know 
00:17:28 00:17:29 440 xxx I'm sure you xxx from your travels

00:17:45 00:17:45 447 yeah 
00:17:45 00:17:46 448 it could have been done xxx 
00:17:46 00:17:49 449 so that you could have a laugh 
00:17:49 00:17:50 450 but somehow I don't know

00:19:40 00:19:41 508 her English is slightly better 
00:19:41 00:19:42 509 now the only reason 
00:19:42 00:19:43 510 we were saying earlier 
00:19:43 00:19:50 511 we criticize is, because we think, 0conj after fifty years, she should be much more fluent 
00:19:50 00:19:51 512 yeah 
00:19:51 00:19:54 513 and she does you are right she does make some a very small amount 
00:19:54 00:19:57 514 I wouldn't like criticize because I think she should be better 
00:19:57 00:20:01 515 but that's not the same thing as saying 0conj she is bad 
00:20:01 00:20:03 516 I know exactly, what you mean 
00:20:03 00:20:08 517 exactly but I've just made the experience, that you stop learning after a while 
00:20:08 00:20:09 518 what is a while 
00:20:09 00:20:14 519 when you when you feel that that your English is sufficient to get along 
00:20:14 00:20:16 520 but my mother was here, when she was nineteen 
00:20:16 00:20:18 521 well it was sufficient for me 
00:20:18 00:20:22 522 for example if you can do your daily routine 
00:20:22 00:20:23 523 that's it that's it 
00:20:23 00:20:25 524 you make a dayly routine you are in business and 
00:20:25 00:20:30 525 xxx and the people 0conj you mix with from the age when you got here were all Viennese German xxx 
00:20:30 00:20:31 526 ja ja ja 
00:20:31 00:20:32 527 so you didn't have to speak a good English 
00:20:32 00:20:32 528 no no 
00:20:32 00:20:33 529 for example 
00:20:33 00:20:34 530 you wouldn't know the difference 
00:20:34 00:20:37 531 most probably you didn't have to take a car to the garage 
00:20:37 00:20:38 532 yes 
00:20:38 00:20:42 533 so maybe you never learnt all the vocabulary related to 
00:20:42 00:20:45 534 ja ja ja you are quite right 
00:20:45 00:20:46 535 xxx and that's the way I find it 
00:20:46 00:20:48 536 ja ja ja ja 
00:20:48 00:20:53 537 I know quite a lot of words about languages literature drama music 
00:20:53 00:20:54 538 that's it 
00:20:54 00:20:55 539 but for example 
00:20:55 00:20:57 540 I'm working as a tour guide during summer 
00:20:57 00:21:01 541 and our coach broke down in the Shetlands last summer 
00:21:01 00:21:02 542 oh gosh 
00:21:02 00:21:08 543 and I had to talk I mean I was the only person who had the third person s@l up there anyway 
00:21:08 00:21:10 544 all of them said 
00:21:10 00:21:10 545 he go 
00:21:10 00:21:12 546 full stop 
00:21:12 00:21:13 547 yeah 
00:21:13 00:21:14 548 not he goes 
00:21:14 00:21:15 549 nothing at all 
00:21:15 00:21:21 550 and I just find it so hard, because I learnt words like &-um inflation pump and 
00:21:21 00:21:24 551 I cannot remember 
00:21:24 00:21:26 552 I'm sure yeah 
00:21:26 00:21:28 553 ja ja ja ja it's true 
00:21:28 00:21:34 554 and what do you call that thing which you use for measuring screws 
00:21:34 00:21:43 555 a thing which you can push together and then you can read on a sort of ruler type thing how how wide the screws are 
00:21:43 00:21:44 556 that's a funny thing 
00:21:44 00:21:47 557 I've just known it from my dad and 
00:21:47 00:21:48 558 a gage 
00:21:48 00:21:49 559 a vernia@n a vernia@n 
00:21:49 00:21:51 560 I think that was it yeah 
00:21:51 00:21:53 561 vernia@n 
00:21:53 00:21:54 562 yes you are right you are right 
00:21:54 00:21:55 563 so it depends on the xxx 
00:21:55 00:21:56 564 ja ja ja 
00:21:56 00:21:57 565 xxx daddy always drove 
00:21:57 00:21:58 566 ja ja ja 
00:21:58 00:22:00 567 it's true of course 
00:22:00 00:22:04 568 I mean you go shopping you meet people you know all the the things 
00:22:04 00:22:04 569 yeah 
00:22:04 00:22:05 570 xxx they specialize xxx 
00:22:05 00:22:08 571 but if you are in another country do you always say 
00:22:08 00:22:17 572 I have just remembered the correction, when you and daddy xxx had to go some xxx you just got off the boat 
00:22:17 00:22:28 573 xxx 
00:22:28 00:22:29 574 deu] wir waren in Bornmouth 
00:22:29 00:22:32 575 deu] wir waren in Bornmouth 
00:22:32 00:22:35 576 I think 0conj she is in the club, die Ilse 
00:22:35 00:22:36 577 yeah 
00:22:36 00:22:37 578 xxx 
00:22:37 00:22:40 579 and we talked you know the men were in the front and we talked in the back 
00:22:40 00:22:42 580 and we talked German very loud 
00:22:42 00:22:45 581 and an English couple stopped and said 
00:22:45 00:22:47 582 how do you like it here 
00:22:47 00:22:48 583 we said

00:24:34 00:24:35 645 you know really so 
00:24:35 00:24:40 646 and if he would know how long we are here, 
00:24:40 00:24:40 647 it's terrible 
00:24:40 00:24:46 648 xxx I know, what you were saying before you went out 
00:24:46 00:24:47 649 when you used to ring me at work 
00:24:47 00:24:48 650 yeah that's right 
00:24:48 00:24:55 651 you used to say you know (be)cause here again it was a very you know sort of very well spoken English people there 
00:24:55 00:24:56 652 and they said &-um 
00:24:56 00:24:59 653 Vivien a foreign lady is on the phone for you 
00:24:59 00:25:03 654 xxx it's my mother 
00:25:03 00:25:05 655 yeah 
00:25:05 00:25:12 656 Lisl told me she is the woman who always switches back to Engish 
00:25:12 00:25:16 657 when I spoke to her in German, she always switched gave me the answers in English 
00:25:16 00:25:23 658 and eh her German accent is so strong that somebody rang her once and got the wrong number 
00:25:23 00:25:29 659 and she just repeating her own number and the person said 
00:25:29 00:25:30 660 oh you are a foreigner 
00:25:30 00:25:35 661 she only speaks English most of the time with such a strong German accent 
00:25:35 00:25:35 662 ja ja 
00:25:35 00:25:39 663 and this person didn't realize, that he had got the wrong person 
00:25:39 00:25:44 664 but just from form the number from the phone number he knew exactly, that she was a foreigner 
00:25:44 00:25:45 665 ja but it's 
00:25:45 00:25:49 666 and she has been here she is quite old

00:25:55 00:25:58 672 why do some people retain their accent and some people don't 
00:25:58 00:25:59 673 but some people are more cleverer xxx

00:26:09 00:26:10 680 you know you speak with them
